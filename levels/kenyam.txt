Title: Origin

Comment:
I've created some dull levels 
when I was young (in the 1980s).
This was the 1st level I created since that time, 
with mature thought. :-)

Made with thinking much of flow 
than difficulty.
But actually this looks dull

Title: Dance In The Hall
Author: kenyam
Comment:
The flow may look strange.
Basically, I don't like the goal in bad shape 
because I believe we still have many ways of 
creating more excellent and difficult levels 
without setting the goal in such odd layouts.
To mitigate the poor appearance of this level, 
I set the boxes in the same shape of the goal.

Title: Cross I
Author: kenyam
Comment:
My 1st thought was to create the goal 
in the cross shape.
(But no religious intention in the design.)
You may find two major ways of solution.
Right or Left ? Fine if you can find both.

Title: Double Vision

Comment:
I had one clear concept in creating this, - 
we can create more difficult levels 
by restricting the player's position 
at the stage clear time.
Please try this to find the way.

Title: Double Detour
Author: kenyam
Comment:
This appears old-style; boxes are apart 
from the goal area at the start time.
Usually, such old levels were easy or dull.
In this meaning, it's not old-style, 
but classic in another meaning.
Pls try this, if little time to play all.

The left part was made first.
Then the right part was created

One idea is what the title shows, 
while the other is no-name
