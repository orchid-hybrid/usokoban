# usokoban

USokoban is an excellent sokoban implementation by Yang Chao.

# this version

I have put it on github and added a makefile, edited slightly to my preference (no need to 'install' it).

# building

type `make`

# running

On first run use `./usokoban` and it will set the current working directory as an absolute path in the preferences file `~/.usokoban`. After that you can run usokoban from any directory.

# levels

I collected some level sets which you can easily find by searching on the internet.
